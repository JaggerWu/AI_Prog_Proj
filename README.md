Please go through this readme before asking questions about the workings of the server.
The following describes the various options for starting the server using provided example clients.
Inspection of the source code for the example clients may yield useful information regarding the implementation of your own client.
The commands below must be executed from the directory containing this readme file.
It is required that the Java runtime environment binaries are available in your system path for the commands below to work.
Note that if you have the CLASSPATH environment variable set, running the server with a client may/will fail.
You should not have the CLASSPATH environment variable set unless you know what you're doing.
