Notes for project

Couldn't find the code. Just reformated my pc and couldn't find the zip on campusnet :(

We made our solution in python and it worked great for us but you should pick what the group members prefer to use.

DO NOT make your AI using Partial-order planning. He speaks a lot about it in the lectures but it has no use in this case. It is a waste of time and makes everything more complex to program. Make something like the searchclient but more advanced and faster.

We started making an AI with POP but shortly before the deadline we scrapped everything and started the normal way. With little time left, we ended up with a program that could handle multiple AIs in many levels but it could only move 1 agent at a time. As a result, our solution was much faster than everybody else and it gave us a lot of points in the competition (1st in speed for multi agent levels and 2nd overall).
If you want to win, spend some time to optimize your solution so you get extra points in the time competition. (but still try to solve as many levels as possible)
